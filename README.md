# Nicer High Contrast

High constrast themes are my favourite because of it's unique color scheme/token colors. Once I got used to it I can't live without it, that's why I came up with an opinionated implementation of a high contrast theme for those who don't need that much high constrast and would rather a better looking code editor.

The font in the screenshot is Operator Mono. You can get/buy it here: http://www.typography.com/blog/introducing-operator
